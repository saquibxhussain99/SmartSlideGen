EXTRACT_TOPICS_MARKERS_TEMPLATE = """
Analyze the given document and extract key topics, following these guidelines:

1. Key Topic Identification:
   - Topics should represent major sections or themes in the document.
   - Each key topic should be substantial enough for at least one slide with 3-5 bullet points, potentially spanning multiple slides.
   - Topics should be broad enough to encompass multiple related points but specific enough to avoid overlap.
   - Identify topics in the order they appear in the document.
   - Consider a new topic when there's a clear shift in the main subject, signaled by transitional phrases, new headings, or a distinct change in content focus.
   - If a topic recurs, don't create a new entry unless it's substantially expanded upon.

2. Key Topic Documentation:
   - For each key topic, create a detailed name that sums up the idea of the section or theme it represents. 
   - Next, provide the first ten words of the section that the key topic represents.

3. Provide the output in the following format:
**<key topic 1>**
first ten words of the section or theme that the key topic 1 represents
**<key topic 2>**
first ten words of the section or theme that the key topic 2 represents
